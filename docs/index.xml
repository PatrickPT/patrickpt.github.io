      <description>TL;DR The following learning notes try to give some intuition on how Stable Diffusion works, some mathematical intuition on Diffusion Models and an introduction to Latent Diffusion Models.
The following sources were extensively used during creation of this learning notes. Passages may be reutilized to create a reasonable overview of the topic. Credit goes to the authors of the following papers and posts.

To test the models here you need to have an account with HuggingFace - for loading the checkpoint or using the endpoints. Hugging Face is a community and data science platform that provides:
Tools that enable users to build, train and deploy ML models based on open source (OS) code and technologies. A place where a broad community of data scientists, researchers, and ML engineers can come together and share ideas, get support and contribute to open source projects.</description>

      <title>A short summary on ChatGPT</title>

      <description>This summary is based on another post: An introduction to ChatGPT written by ChatGPT
While testing out ChatGPT for some weeks now, i found that texts created by it are often repetitive and monotonous. In this post i tried to condense the meaningful information from the other post.
2022 was the year of generative AI. Generative AI refers to machine learning algorithms that can create new meaning from text, images, code, and other forms of content.</description>

      <description>ChatGPT: Optimizing Language Models for Dialogue
What to do if you have 15Min time to spare? Feed ChatGPT with prompts to write an introductory article about ChatGPT. And I promise, this is the only part which is not based on a Large Language Model. Everything else was written by ChatGPT. For better readability I replaced the prompts with simple headers.
What is ChatGPT? Are you tired of boring, robotic chatbots that can’t hold a conversation or understand your needs?</description>

      <title>Why and how do you create your own AI blog?</title>

      <description>Welcome to my blog.
Why not Medium? It is 2023 and there are plenty of easy ways to create content about ML, Data Science and AI on the internet. In fact with the accessability of platforms like Medium it is super easy.
Isn&amp;rsquo;t it actually dumb to create your own blog instead of using these possibilities?
Maybe, but my purpose is not to attract as many readers as possible but to learn something and make my learnings accessable for others.</description>

      <description>This is a list of links to stuff i found interesting recently. It will be updated regulary(whatever that means).
It could be a link to a paper, a nice repo or a news article. This selection is highly subjective, reflects my interests and depends on my reading habit, time, people i follow and recommender algorithms from the platforms i visit. It is not complete and is not scientific.
I am not responsible for the linked content and it does not contain my opinion:</description>

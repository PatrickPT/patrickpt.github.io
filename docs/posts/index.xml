      <description>TLDR; A short Hands On with (Large) Language Models: What are the ideas behind Language Models and how can you train your own with nanoGPT?
What are Language Models Large Language Models are rapidly transforming natural language processing tasks and have led to a huge hype around Artificial Intelligence and associated tasks. Especially with the introduction of GPT3.5(ChatGPT) in 2022 many people are interested in the capabilities of ML. But what is the foundation for the products that could impact our future world significantly?</description>

      <description>TLDR; Learn how to train a Reinforcement Learning Agent to play GameBoy games in a Python written Emulator. With PyBoy, Q-Learning and Super Mario.
Train your own RL Agent to play Super Mario Recently i stumbled upon my old GameBoy an immediately started it and tried to start where i left off 20 years ago. Unfortunately my hand eye coordination is not what it used to be so i died a few fast deaths.</description>

      <description>Today i passed the Google Professional Machine Learning Engineer Exam in a onsite test center in Duesseldorf. I prepared for it 4 weeks with different ressources. I have multiple years experience on Data Science and ML and about one year experience with ML on GCP. Following article should summarize all sources which were helpful for me in preparation of the certification exam. If you are interested in how the exam is actually happening there are plenty of other articles on medium or at other places.</description>

      <description>Storytelling and presentation are the keys to a succesful adoption of your ideas. While storytelling is often verbal, a presentation is what stays and often is the thing that decideds whether your stakeholders pay attention or not so much. So it has to be aesthetic, clear and simple.
I show a lot of ideas and often i tend to recreate stuff from my code documentation enriched with diagrams. It is often a tedious work, recreating things in Powerpoint.</description>

      <description>TL;DR The following learning notes try to give some intuition on how Stable Diffusion works, some mathematical intuition on Diffusion Models and an introduction to Latent Diffusion Models.
The following sources were extensively used during creation of this learning notes. Passages may be reutilized to create a reasonable overview of the topic. Credit goes to the authors of the following papers and posts.

To test the models here you need to have an account with HuggingFace - for loading the checkpoint or using the endpoints. Hugging Face is a community and data science platform that provides:
Tools that enable users to build, train and deploy ML models based on open source (OS) code and technologies. A place where a broad community of data scientists, researchers, and ML engineers can come together and share ideas, get support and contribute to open source projects.</description>

      <title>A short summary on ChatGPT</title>

      <description>This summary is based on another post: An introduction to ChatGPT written by ChatGPT
While testing out ChatGPT for some weeks now, i found that texts created by it are often repetitive and monotonous. In this post i tried to condense the meaningful information from the other post.
2022 was the year of generative AI. Generative AI refers to machine learning algorithms that can create new meaning from text, images, code, and other forms of content.</description>

      <description>ChatGPT: Optimizing Language Models for Dialogue
What to do if you have 15Min time to spare? Feed ChatGPT with prompts to write an introductory article about ChatGPT. And I promise, this is the only part which is not based on a Large Language Model. Everything else was written by ChatGPT. For better readability I replaced the prompts with simple headers.
What is ChatGPT? Are you tired of boring, robotic chatbots that can’t hold a conversation or understand your needs?</description>

      <title>Why and how do you create your own AI blog?</title>

      <description>Welcome to my blog.
Why not Medium? It is 2023 and there are plenty of easy ways to create content about ML, Data Science and AI on the internet. In fact with the accessability of platforms like Medium it is super easy.
Isn&amp;rsquo;t it actually dumb to create your own blog instead of using these possibilities?
Maybe, but my purpose is not to attract as many readers as possible but to learn something and make my learnings accessable for others.</description>

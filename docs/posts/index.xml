      <description>TL;DR This blogpost focusses on AI Architecture and specifically on Retrieval Augemnted Generation. Retrieval Augmented Generation can be used to productionize LLM models for enterprise architecture easily.
Why should i care? Intuitive would be to train a Large Language Model with domain specific data, in other words, to fine-tune the model-weights with custom data. But fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is a complex and resource-intensive process due to several key factors:</description>

      <description>TL;DR This blogpost focusses on ML Design and Architecture and tries to give some intuition and hints for deciding between one generalized and multiple specialized models for the same business requriement and dataset.
Consider it a nudge to dive deeper into the topic
Why should i care? Transparency in machine learning is crucial for business stakeholders because it fosters trust and informed decision-making. Business Stakeholders need to understand not only the potential benefits but also the limitations and risks associated with machine learning models.</description>

      <title>What are Transformers?</title>

      <description>What are Transformers Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that was introduced in the paper &amp;ldquo;Attention is All You Need&amp;rdquo; by Vaswani et al. in 2017. Since then, it has become one of the most popular and successful models in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as language translation, summarization, and text classification. Furthermore it is the foundation for Language Models and their application.
The key innovation of the Transformer architecture is the use of attention mechanisms.</description>

      <description>I enlisted for the free Get Certified Program from Google in June 2023 which offers a 10 week curated curriculum to prepare for the Data Engineer exam. Unfortunately the content is restricted and cannot be shared. Following article should summarize all additional sources which were helpful for me in preparation of the certification exam. If you are interested in how the exam is actually happening there are plenty of other articles on medium or at other places.</description>

      <description>TL;DR A short summary on (Large) Language Models: What are the ideas and concepts behind Language Models?
What are Language Models Large Language Models are rapidly transforming natural language processing tasks and have led to a huge hype around Artificial Intelligence and associated tasks. Especially with the introduction of GPT3.5(ChatGPT) in 2022 many people are interested in the capabilities of ML. But what is the foundation for the products that could impact our future world significantly?</description>

      <description>TL;DR Learn how to train a Reinforcement Learning Agent to play GameBoy games in a Python written Emulator. With PyBoy, Q-Learning and Super Mario.
Train your own RL Agent to play Super Mario Recently i stumbled upon my old GameBoy an immediately started it and tried to start where i left off 20 years ago. Unfortunately my hand eye coordination is not what it used to be so i died a few fast deaths.</description>

      <description>Today i passed the Google Professional Machine Learning Engineer Exam in a onsite test center in Duesseldorf. I prepared for it 4 weeks with different ressources. I have multiple years experience on Data Science and ML and about one year experience with ML on GCP. Following article should summarize all sources which were helpful for me in preparation of the certification exam. If you are interested in how the exam is actually happening there are plenty of other articles on medium or at other places.</description>

      <description>Storytelling and presentation are the keys to a succesful adoption of your ideas. While storytelling is often verbal, a presentation is what stays and often is the thing that decideds whether your stakeholders pay attention or not so much. So it has to be aesthetic, clear and simple.
I show a lot of ideas and often i tend to recreate stuff from my code documentation enriched with diagrams. It is often a tedious work, recreating things in Powerpoint.</description>

      <description>TL;DR The following learning notes try to give some intuition on how Stable Diffusion works, some mathematical intuition on Diffusion Models and an introduction to Latent Diffusion Models.
The following sources were extensively used during creation of this learning notes. Passages may be reutilized to create a reasonable overview of the topic. Credit goes to the authors of the following papers and posts.

To test the models here you need to have an account with HuggingFace - for loading the checkpoint or using the endpoints. Hugging Face is a community and data science platform that provides:
Tools that enable users to build, train and deploy ML models based on open source (OS) code and technologies. A place where a broad community of data scientists, researchers, and ML engineers can come together and share ideas, get support and contribute to open source projects.</description>

      <description>This summary is based on another post: An introduction to ChatGPT written by ChatGPT
While testing out ChatGPT for some weeks now, i found that texts created by it are often repetitive and monotonous. In this post i tried to condense the meaningful information from the other post.
2022 was the year of generative AI. Generative AI refers to machine learning algorithms that can create new meaning from text, images, code, and other forms of content.</description>

      <description>ChatGPT: Optimizing Language Models for Dialogue
What to do if you have 15Min time to spare? Feed ChatGPT with prompts to write an introductory article about ChatGPT. And I promise, this is the only part which is not based on a Large Language Model. Everything else was written by ChatGPT. For better readability I replaced the prompts with simple headers.
What is ChatGPT? Are you tired of boring, robotic chatbots that canât hold a conversation or understand your needs?</description>

      <title>Why and how do you create your own AI blog?</title>

      <description>Welcome to my blog.
Why not Medium? It is 2023 and there are plenty of easy ways to create content about ML, Data Science and AI on the internet. In fact with the accessability of platforms like Medium it is super easy.
Isn&amp;rsquo;t it actually dumb to create your own blog instead of using these possibilities?
Maybe, but my purpose is not to attract as many readers as possible but to learn something and make my learnings accessable for others.</description>

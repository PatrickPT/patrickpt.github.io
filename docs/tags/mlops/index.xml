      <description>Today i passed the Google Professional Machine Learning Engineer Exam in a onsite test center in Duesseldorf. I prepared for it 4 weeks with different ressources. I have multiple years experience on Data Science and ML and about one year experience with ML on GCP. Following article should summarize all sources which were helpful for me in preparation of the certification exam. If you are interested in how the exam is actually happening there are plenty of other articles on medium or at other places.</description>

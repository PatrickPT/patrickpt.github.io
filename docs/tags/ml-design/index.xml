      <description>TL;DR This blogpost focusses on AI Architecture and specifically on Retrieval Augemnted Generation. Retrieval Augemnted Generation can be used to productionize LLM models for entreprise architecture easily.
Why should i care? Intuitive would be to train a Large Language Model with domain specific data, in other words, to fine-tune the model-weights with custom data. But fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is a complex and resource-intensive process due to several key factors:</description>

      <description>TL;DR This blogpost focusses on ML Design and Architecture and tries to give some intuition and hints for deciding between one generalized and multiple specialized models for the same business requriement and dataset.
Consider it a nudge to dive deeper into the topic
Why should i care? Transparency in machine learning is crucial for business stakeholders because it fosters trust and informed decision-making. Business Stakeholders need to understand not only the potential benefits but also the limitations and risks associated with machine learning models.</description>

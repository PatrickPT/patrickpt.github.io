      <description>TL;DR This blogpost shows an example for a Chatbot that uses Retrieval Augemnted Generation to retrieve domain specific knowledge before querying a Large Language Model
Hands on with Retrieval Augmented Generation For a primer on Retrieval Augemnted Generation please read my other post What is Retrieval Augmented Generation?.
Retrieval Augemnted Generation can be a powerful architecture to easily built knowledge retrieval applications which (based on a recent study) even outperform LLM&amp;rsquo;s with long context windows.</description>

      <description>TL;DR This blogpost tries to explain Retrieval Augmented Generation. Retrieval Augmented Generation is an Architecture used for NLp tasks which can be used to productionize LLM models for enterprise architecture easily.
Why should i care? Intuitive would be to train a Large Language Model with domain specific data, in other words, to fine-tune the model-weights with custom data. But fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is a complex and resource-intensive process due to several key factors:</description>

      <description>TL;DR A short summary on (Large) Language Models: What are the ideas and concepts behind Language Models?
What are Language Models Large Language Models are rapidly transforming natural language processing tasks and have led to a huge hype around Artificial Intelligence and associated tasks. Especially with the introduction of GPT3.5(ChatGPT) in 2022 many people are interested in the capabilities of ML. But what is the foundation for the products that could impact our future world significantly?</description>

      <description>This summary is based on another post: An introduction to ChatGPT written by ChatGPT
While testing out ChatGPT for some weeks now, i found that texts created by it are often repetitive and monotonous. In this post i tried to condense the meaningful information from the other post.
2022 was the year of generative AI. Generative AI refers to machine learning algorithms that can create new meaning from text, images, code, and other forms of content.</description>

      <description>ChatGPT: Optimizing Language Models for Dialogue
What to do if you have 15Min time to spare? Feed ChatGPT with prompts to write an introductory article about ChatGPT. And I promise, this is the only part which is not based on a Large Language Model. Everything else was written by ChatGPT. For better readability I replaced the prompts with simple headers.
What is ChatGPT? Are you tired of boring, robotic chatbots that canâ€™t hold a conversation or understand your needs?</description>

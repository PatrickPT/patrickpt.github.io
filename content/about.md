Hi, I’m Patrick, a technologist at heart with a passion for artificial intelligence, data science, and lifelong learning. I thrive on working with great people to build innovative AI-driven products that make a real impact.

Currently, I lead the Data Science department at Vodafone, where my team and I apply machine learning and AI to create solutions that drive business value and enhance customer experiences. My role allows me to bridge the gap between AI research and real-world applications, ensuring that our models don’t just live in Jupyter notebooks but actively contribute to decision-making, automation, and optimization.

My journey into AI wasn’t just about the technology—it was about solving complex problems and understanding how data can tell a story. Over the years, I’ve worked on a range of projects, from developing churn prediction models that help retain customers, to AI-driven recommendation engines that personalize experiences, and even forecasting models that optimize inventory and financial planning.

Beyond my professional work, I am deeply committed to learning and sharing knowledge. I write about AI because I believe that the more we demystify these technologies, the more people can leverage them to create meaningful change. Whether it's through my blog, mentoring, or collaborating with peers, I find joy in making complex topics accessible and engaging.

On a personal note, I’m a father of two, an avid cyclist, and someone who enjoys the constant challenge of pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I believe that continuous learning and personal growth are key in a rapidly evolving field like AI.

This blog is my space to share insights, break down AI concepts, and discuss how we can make AI more impactful, ethical, and innovative. I look forward to engaging with others who share the same curiosity and enthusiasm for the future of AI.

My blog contains my personal opinions and as i am human also errors. I am happy to receive feedback and corrections.

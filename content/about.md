![Me](content/me.jpg)

Welcomy to my blog. I am Patrick. I’m documenting my learning notes, best practices and how-tos in this blog. Other than writing an AI blog, I’m leading a Data Science Team at Vodafone on the side.

I'm living in Germany, am a proud father of two and love to dig into ML, discuss politics and do sports.

This blog may contain errors so i am happy to receive your change requests via [Github](https://github.com/PatrickPT/patrickpt.github.io).

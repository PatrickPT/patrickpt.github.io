Today i passed the Google Professional Machine Learning Engineer Exam in a onsite test center in Duesseldorf. I prepared for it 4 weeks with different ressources. I have multiple years experience on Data Science and ML and about one year experience with ML on GCP.
Following article should summarize all sources which were helpful for me in preparation of the certification exam.
If you are interested in how the exam is actually happening there are plenty of other articles on medium or at other places. I just try to condense it to the minimum here.

# Key takeaways

- A significant amount of knowledge covered in the exam also came from Google’s machine learning crash course.
- The questions on Cloudskillboost not neccessarily help with passing the exam
- You need a basic understanding of how MLOps works and which Google solutions supports which part in the process
- Think efficient - what is the easiest solution
- Think like a ML practicioner
- Read carefully the question and look for key-words: Cost, time, serverless, etc.
- Read carefully the answers and think of consequences of the solutions and try to identify the best solution
- Look into other sources on Medium of people who recently took the exam and try to identify new topics
- Search for Exam Dumps on deidcated sources like Examtopics. They may be helpful in preparation.

# Key topics

- Distributed Learning

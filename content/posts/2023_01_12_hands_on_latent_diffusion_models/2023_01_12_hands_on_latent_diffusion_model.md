*This post is based on another post which looks closer into the math and tries to give an introduction on Latent Diffusion Models:*

# Recap on Latent Diffusion Models

There are mutiple sites and blog posts which explain Latent Diffusion Models.
I want to share one which explains everything with diagrams(Because i like diagrams for learning).

### I didn't understand anyting you just said

You don't have any idea what this is all about?
Then this is for you:
AI can generate beautiful pictures now
All you need to do is create a prompt and enter it into any tool using an algorithm like stable-diffusion which renders your image then.
1. So think of a prompt
[Examples with prompt search](https://lexica.art/)
2. and got to [Dall-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) open an account and try it out.

# Quickstart

You are not interested in getting your hands dirty?
You just want to produce some nice looking images and test your prompt skills?
You are not willing to pay a certain amount to use the capabilities of OpenAI's [Dall-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/)?

## Prompt Ideas and References

For starters, do you have any idea what you want to create and how to best create your initial prompt?

*This summary is based on another post: [An introduction to ChatGPT written by ChatGPT](content/posts/2023_01_07_intro_chatgpt/2023_01_07_intro_chatgpt.md)*

*While testing out ChatGPT for some weeks now, i found that texts created by it are often repetitive and monotonous in this post i tried to condense the meaningful information from the other post.*

2022 was the year of generative AI. Generative AI refers to machine learning algorithms that can create new meaning from text, images, code, and other forms of content. Leading generative AI tools are: DeepMind’s Alpha Code (GoogleLab), OpenAI's ChatGPT, GPT-3.5, DALL-E, MidJourney, Jasper, and Stable Diffusion, which are large language models and image generators.

Especially ChatGPT(Generative Pre-trained Transformer) by OpenAI(an artificial intelligence research laboratory), the latest in AI language models had serious media attention in the last weeks.
Derek Thompson wrote in The Atlantic's "Breakthroughs of the Year" for 2022, that ChatGPT as part of "the generative-AI eruption" that "may change our mind about how we work, how we think, and what human creativity really is".

# What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT technology is built upon OpenAI’s GPT3 AI platform which houses some of the world’s largest language models, using both supervised and unsupervised AI learning techniques. GPT3, also known as Generative Pretrained Transformer 3, is a large language model trained by OpenAI. It is capable of generating human-like text and has been used for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including language translation, summarization, and question answering.

# How does ChatGPT work?

The collection of data and reward model in ChatGPT are two key components of the model’s training process. In order to generate human-like text and engage in natural conversations, ChatGPT must be trained on large amounts of data and be able to learn from the feedback it receives.
To collect data for ChatGPT, the model is exposed to a wide range of conversational data, including transcripts of real-life conversations, dialogue from books and movies, and other sources of conversational text. This data is used to train the model and help it understand the structure and patterns of natural language.
The reward model in ChatGPT is used to evaluate the model’s performance and provide feedback on its responses. This is done through a process known as reinforcement learning, in which the model is rewarded for generating responses that are relevant, appropriate, and human-like, and is penalized for generating responses that are irrelevant or nonsensical. This feedback helps the model to learn and improve its performance over time.

The success of ChatGPT is based on training with human feedback, so-called reinforcement learning on human feedback. OpenAI incentivises the feedback process in the latest ChatGPT version in order to obtain even more feedback data and sees RLHF as fundamental for artificial intelligence that takes human needs into account and thus for the development of further AI systems.
Policies help to prevent ChatGPT from generating inappropriate or offensive responses, and can ensure that the model behaves in a way that aligns with the values and standards of the organization or individuals using it. For example, a policy might dictate that ChatGPT should not generate responses that are sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory.

# What are the pitfalls of ChatGPT?

However, like all current AI systems, ChatGPT is not capable of true intelligence or understanding, and its responses are based on the data it has been trained on and the algorithms that govern its behavior. ChatGPT lacks the ability to truly understand the complexity of human language and conversation. It is simply trained to generate words based on a given input, but it does not have the ability to truly comprehend the meaning behind those words. This means that any responses it generates are likely to be shallow and lacking in depth and insight.
Similarly, if the model is trained on data that is biased or discriminatory, it may generate responses that are unfair or offensive, but that sound reasonable or logical.
Therefore, it is important to carefully monitor and evaluate ChatGPT’s responses, and to provide the model with high-quality, accurate data to train on. This can help to prevent the model from generating wrong answers that sound right, and can help to ensure that ChatGPT is used in an ethical and responsible manner.

# What brings the future?
The adoption of conversational AI models like ChatGPT into everday work will be something we see in the next few months to years. Despite all their problems they still have enormous capabilities to fasten and improve daily work. Another recent example is Github Copilot. Copilot is powered by the OpenAI Codex, an artificial intelligence model created by OpenAI  The OpenAI Codex is a modified, production version of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), a language model using deep-learning to produce human-like text. The Codex model is additionally trained on gigabytes of source code in a dozen programming languages. While ChatGPT also can generate Code, Copilot is really focussing on getting the job done and specifically designed to help you coding.

While ChatGPT is an impressive development in AI, it is still only a teaser for what is to come with GPT4. GPT4 is the next generation of the GPT language model, and is expected to be even more powerful and capable than ChatGPT.
While GPT-4 consists of 170 trillion parameters compared to GPT-3’s 175 billion parameters. This allows GPT-4 to process and generate text with greater accuracy and fluency. 

*2023 will be exciting.*

# TLDR;

This blogpost focusses on ML Design and Architecture and tries to give some hints for deciding between one generalized and multiple specialized models for the same business requriement and dataset.

# What's the catch?

Transparency in machine learning is crucial for business stakeholders because it fosters trust and informed decision-making. Business Stakeholders need to understand not only the potential benefits but also the limitations and risks associated with machine learning models.

As Data scientists we play an important role in this process, as they bridge the gap between complex algorithms and business objectives. Educating stakeholders about the inner workings of machine learning algorithms, their inputs, outputs, and potential biases, empowers them to make well-informed decisions, manage expectations, and mitigate risks effectively.

> But this customer segment has way higher churn, shouldn't the model focus only on this segment only?

This is one of the examples when you as a ML Engineer need to shed some light on your choices and the "machine room" aka the used algorithm to make clear how the model works.

# UseCase

We are focussing on a "Bread and Butter" Binary Classification Model for Churn in the Telecommunications sector and try to make a comparison between the two approaches.

"Churn" refers to the phenomenon where customers switch from one telecommunications service provider to another or discontinue their subscription altogether. It is a significant metric and concern for telecommunications companies because retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

A binary classification model is a type of machine learning model used to classify data into one of two categories: a positive class (labeled as *1*) or a negative class (labeled as *0*). It learns from labeled data during training and uses features to make predictions. The model is evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score and can be applied to various tasks, such as spam detection, disease diagnosis, and sentiment analysis. It's a fundamental tool for making decisions with two possible outcomes.

# General Models vs Specialized Models

Suppose we have a dataset which consist of a matrix of predictors (called *X*) and a target variable (called *y*). *X* contains *n* columns(features) that could be used to segment the dataset. E.g. a dataset can be segmented by age, product, sales channel, network experience...

So what are the two approaches we want to look into:

> **General Model**
>
> One main model is fitted on the whole training set including all segments, then the performance is measured on the test set.

> **Specialized Model**
>
> The dataset is splitted into each segment and for each of these subsets a unique model is fitted. This means that we repeat training and testing for the number of *k* segments.

## Intuition

Using specialized models has obviously some practical disadvantages as you need to do some tasks *k* times which leads to
- higher complexity
- higher effort on maintenance
- almost redundant processes

**So why should anyone favour specialized models?**

The prejudice against general models is as following: Advocates for specialized models argue that a single, all-encompassing model might lack precision within a specific subset, as it would have learned the characteristics of various other subsets. 

This intuition was in my opinion built on top of the assumption that all Machine Learning Models work similary to simple models like e.g. linear regression.
Linear regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between the independent variable(s) *X* and the dependent variable *y*. This means that the relationship can be approximated by a straight line. While it assumes linearity, it can be extended to capture more complex relationships by introducing higher-order terms or using more advanced regression techniques like polynomial regression or multiple linear regression when dealing with multiple independent variables.
Still it lacks accuracy if the dataset contains different behaviours.

The intuition does not neccessarily hold true for the de facto standard algorithm for tabular data: Boosted Tree Models like XGBoost,LightGBM or CatBoost.

## Adavntages of Boosted Tree Models vs Linear Models

Boosted tree algorithms, like Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost, outperform linear models like linear regression in modeling complexity due to their ability to:

- **Handle Non-Linearity:** Boosted trees capture non-linear relationships, unlike linear regression, which assumes linearity.

- **Ensemble Learning:** They use ensemble learning to combine multiple decision trees, enabling them to create complex models.

- **Feature Interactions:** Boosted trees automatically detect and model feature interactions, which linear regression struggles with.

- **Robustness to Outliers:** They are more robust to outliers and noisy data, making them suitable for real-world scenarios.

- **Model Flexibility:** Boosted trees adapt to data complexity by adding more trees to the ensemble.

- **Handling Heterogeneous Data: They handle various data types, including categorical features, without extensive preprocessing.

Fewer Assumptions: Unlike linear regression, they have fewer rigid assumptions, making them versatile in diverse datasets.

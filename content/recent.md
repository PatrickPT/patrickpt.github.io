This is a list of links to stuff i found interesting recently. It will be updated regulary(whatever that means).

It could be a link to a paper, a nice repo or a news article. This list is **highly subjective, reflects my opinions and interests** and depends on my reading habit, time, people i follow and recommender algorithms from the platforms i visit. It is not complete and is not scientific.

This is a list of links to stuff i found interesting recently. It will be updated regulary(whatever that means).

It could be a link to a paper, a nice repo or a news article. This list is highly subjective and depends on my reading habit, time, people i follow and topics i am interested in. It is not complete and is not scientific.
